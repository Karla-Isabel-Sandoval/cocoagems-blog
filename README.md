 It would be awesome if you could write up a short trip report that I can compile and share with the rest of the company

Nashville Tennessee Code Conf Wednesday June 24th to Saturday June 27th

The trip was awesome. We boarded our planes around 10:55 the morning of June 24th, 2015. Nashville, Tennessee the home of country music was our destination but first we had an LAX layover. 

What was the point of codeconf and re-ocurring theme/ talk topics?
Open source licenses and businesses - pivoting and open sourcing previously closed source businesses such as IBM and Microsoft.
Community- brining people together, sharing stories, learning about how people are using open source and learnign about how open source adoption by Microsoft and IBM is restructuring  their culture and the way they do business.

Throughtout the talks and workshops it was clear that many of the talks were about learning more about Open Source, Atom the new editor, diverstiy and inclusion, open source at a scale, creating chaos from order and also about the many and varied background that people in tech have.


Some of my favorite talks inclued Lee Dohms Conversational Aikido - "Lessons in Moderation", Ariel Waldman's "The Hacker's Guide to the Galaxy", Allen Smith's Managing an Open Source Project and Pete Goodlife's closing Keynote on Becoming a Better Programmer.

Aside of programming and Tech I appreciated and learned about the beauty and quirkiness of the south via

Nashville streets are clean, they're architecture is magnaminous and their storms are summer storms are unpredictable.

Without the conference I would not have had the opportunity to learn about the following: 

Open Source 
Atom's Release
Networking
Meeting people who's faces we only knew of in the shape of an Avatar
Meeting Corrine Warnshuis Executive Director of Girl Develop It- the meet up that helped me realize that learning to code is powerful and that coding is possible.
Visiting the Github Nashville Remote office
Lightning Talks
The Hackers Guide to the Galaxy
Becoming a better programmer
Traveling to a conference outside of CA for the first time
Meeting Scott Chacon the man in the blue flannel,jeans,cowboy hat and boots for the first time. Reading the Git books preface from Fort Dallas to SF and realizing that the man in the cowboy boots and beats was the author of the Git Book.
